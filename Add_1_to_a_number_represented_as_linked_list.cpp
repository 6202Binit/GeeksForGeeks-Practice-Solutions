/*
A number (n) is represented in Linked List such that each digit corresponds to a node in linked list. Add 1 to it.

Input:
You have to complete the method which takes one argument: the head of the linked list. You should not read any input from stdin/console.. There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually

Output:
Your function should return pointer to head of the modified list.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 50
1 <=n<= 10000
